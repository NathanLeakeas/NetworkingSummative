/**
 * Write a simple web server that recognizes only the GET request (without the Host: request parameter and blank line). When a client connects to your server and sends a command, 
 * such as GET filename HTTP/1.1, then return a header HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    followed by a blank line and all lines in the file. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, return 404 Not Found instead.
    Your server should listen to port 8080. Test your web server by starting up your web browser and loading a page, such as localhost:8080/c:\cs1\myfile.html.
